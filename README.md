# Java Programming for Data

## A. Several Data Structures
### 1. List
I wrote the code to implement Dynamic array and linked list.
### 2. Trees
I wrote implementation of Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree.
### 3. Graphs
I focused on the Undirected, Unweighted Graph and Directed, Weighted Graph.

## B. Text Data Analysis
This program includes two parts:
### 1. Tokenization
I tokenized the input text to create list of normalized words.
### 2. Analysis
I utilized hash table for fast text analysis, including number of each word or each word pair, words and word pairs that appear the most or the least in the input text, the most common collocations apart from ones for excluded words, generating word string in which each word is the most common word following its previous words.
